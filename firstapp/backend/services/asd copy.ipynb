In addition, the curriculum provides breadth through numerous choices for science, engineering, humanities and fine arts courses. As computing is a discipline with strong links to many fields, this provides students with unparalleled flexibility to pursue allied (or non-allied) interests. Students apply to, and are directly admitted into, the School of Computer Science. Admitted students may choose to pursue an undergraduate degree in Computer Science and, upon successful completion, are awarded a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. Suitably prepared students from other Carnegie Mellon colleges are eligible to apply for internal transfer to the School of Computer Science and will be considered for transfer if grades in core CS requirements are sufficiently high and space is available. Students in the B.S. program in Computer Science are expected to acquire the following skills upon graduation: Due to the tremendous number of ongoing research projects within the School, many students obtain part-time or summer jobs, or receive independent study credit, working on research while pursuing their undergraduate degree. Students seeking a research/graduate school career may pursue an intensive course of research, equivalent to four classroom courses, culminating in the preparation of a senior research thesis. SCS also offers a B.S. degree in Artificial Intelligence, a B.S. degree in Computational Biology, a B.S. degree in Human-Computer Interaction, and a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and the Arts (jointly with the College of Fine Arts). More detail about the Artificial Intelligence major, the Computational Biology major and the Computer Science and the Arts program is available in separate sections of the Undergraduate Catalog. SCS offers additional majors in Computer Science (for non-CS majors), Human-Computer Interaction, and Robotics, and minors in Computational Biology, Computer Science (for non-CS majors), Human-Computer Interaction, Language Technologies, Machine Learning, Neural Computation, Robotics, and Software Engineering.

We don’t use a calculation to choose who to admit because calculations can’t take into account all the factors we consider when making admission decisions. No single grade, factor, score or activity will automatically gain or deny you admission to Carnegie Mellon. We treat every applicant as an individual, taking great care to make our admission decisions fair, thorough and sensitive. We’re interested in students who can be successful at Carnegie Mellon while taking full advantage of all the university has to offer. Our admission process is designed to select a highly talented, diverse undergraduate population with high aspirations who will succeed at Carnegie Mellon. If you’re applying to academic programs, your high school performance will be a significant factor in our admission decision because it’s the most meaningful indication of your motivation and abilities. We pay close attention to your curriculum rigor, the grades you’ve earned and the work you’ve accomplished. We’re interested in seeing that you’ve challenged yourself within your secondary school environment. If you’re applying to programs in the arts, your artistic performance will be either the main factor or a significant factor (depending on the program) in our admission decision. Standardized test scores add to our knowledge of your preparation, but we don’t make decisions on the basis of test scores alone. Carnegie Mellon is test optional for fall 2025 undergraduate admission applications. However, students applying to the School of Computer Science are strongly encouraged to submit either an SAT or ACT score, including the math subscore, to bolster their application's strength and to aid in determining their ability to succeed academically at Carnegie Mellon.Pursuant to this policy, applicants aren't required to submit SAT or ACT results; however, results will be considered for those who submit them. Students who are unable to take either the SAT or ACT or choose not to submit their standardized test scores will be considered equally for admission along with those who submit scores.Please also note that submission of any prior SAT Subject Test results won’t be considered in our admission review process. Your non-academic interests, including extracurricular involvement, part-time jobs, family commitments, hobbies and community engagement play a very important role in the admission process. We also consider collaboration, perseverance, passion, advocacy for others and self-direction when making admission decisions. We’re interested in students who can be successful at Carnegie Mellon while fully engaging in the university community.Because we want to have a sense of who you are as a person, we look closely at your Common Application essay, your short answer questions, your secondary school counselor's evaluation and your secondary school teacher's recommendation. By looking at this non-academic information, we develop a sense of your personality, motivation and responsibility. We don't consider demonstrated interest in our admission process.\"}]\n",

HEARST MUSEUM OF ANTHROPOLOGY Topics of Discussion for California Indian Food and Culture Lessons This kit is designed to explain the various ways in which Native Californians collected, prepared, and stored the foods they ate. There was a great variety of plant and wildlife resources available to these groups. This teaching guide will describe differences in food preferences and common lifeways patterns. You may teach the kit in lessons, organize it into chapters, or rearrange the materials to best suit your curriculum. A glossary is included; you may wish to supplement this list.',\n",
       " 'Review questions are supplied at the end of the lessons to spur further discussion; as well as activities which can be used as the starting point for hands-on interaction with the material. Here are some questions you might ask before beginning the lesson to get students interested in the topic: What type of foods do you like to eat? What do you usually eat for dinner? Do you know how your food is cooked? What type of foods do you think California Indians ate? PHOEBE A. HEARST MUSEUM OF ANTHROPOLOGY California Indians were the first people to live in the area now known as California. California had a population of about 310,000 people when Spanish settlers reached the state in 1769. California tribes differed in the languages they spoke, the regions they lived in, and the foods that they ate. California Indians lived all over the state. They lived in different ecological zones. Some tribes lived near the sea, while others lived near rivers or lakes. There were also tribes that lived in the mountains, valleys, and the desert. Certain natural resources were found throughout the state. Groups from different ecological zones often traded. The Nisenan in the mountains traded black oak acorns and sugar-pine nuts for salt, game, fish, roots, grasses, beads, and shells with tribes living near the sea. Tribes living away from the ocean, such as the Cahuilla, traveled to the coast to fish and gather seafood and seaweed. California Indians PHOEBE A. HEARST MUSEUM OF ANTHROPOLOGY Plants California Indians ate many different plant foods; such as acorns, mushrooms, seaweed, and flowering plants. Seeds, berries, nuts, leaves, stems and roots were all parts of plants that were eaten. Plants were gathered from both the land and the sea.',\n",
       " 'These plants supplied most of the carbohydrates for California Indians. Acorns were a popular food for many groups because during the harvest season they were plenti- ful and could be dried and stored easily for the winter. PHOEBE A. HEARST MUSEUM OF ANTHROPOLOGY Acorn Preparation Tools Pomo boiling stones, boiling basket, tongs, mush paddle soaproot brushes mortar looped stirrers PHOEBE A. HEARST MUSEUM OF ANTHROPOLOGY From centuries of experence, California Indian women learned how to gather the very best acorns from oak trees. Newly picked acorns are too soft to cook with. After being collected in baskets, the acorns had to be dried. Fresh acorns were usually stored for one year before they were used. Once the acorns dried, their shells were cracked open in order to reach the nutmeat. Acorn shells could be opened with small hammer stones and stone anvils. The shells were then removed by hand. Essie Parrish (Kashaya Pomo) cracking and shelling acorns, Sonoma Co.; 1960 Acorn Preparation PHOEBE A. HEARST MUSEUM OF ANTHROPOLOGY Winnowing Once all the acorns were cracked open it was time for winnowing. Like peanuts, acorns have a thin skin around them that needs to be removed. The acorns were put into a scoop shaped basket and rubbed by hand until the skins loosened. Then they were tossed into the air and their lightweight skins blew away in the breeze. The heavy acorns dropped back into the basket. winnowing basket and pine nuts PHOEBE A. HEARST MUSEUM OF ANTHROPOLOGY Acorn Pounding California Indian women used two types of tools to pound acorns. These tools are called mortars and pestles and milling stones. Acorn pounding was hard work. Women often spent an entire day pounding acorns into meal.',\n",
       " 'Women sang songs and made time for talking, teasing, and laughing while pounding acorns to make the chore fun. Essie Parrish (Kashaya Pomo) pounding acorn with a milling stone, Sonoma Co.; 1960 PHOEBE A. HEARST MUSEUM OF ANTHROPOLOGY Acorn Sifting After the acorn meal was pounded, it was then carefully sifted into a fine flour. A few handfuls of meal were put in the sifting basket and the basket was shaken carefully. The fine meal stuck to the basket and the heavier pieces rose to the surface. The larger pieces were put into another basket and the fine flour was swept into a third basket with a soaproot brush. The larger pieces were then pounded again with the next batch of acorns. Essie Parrish (Kashaya Pomo) sifting acorn, Sonoma Co.; 1960 PHOEBE A. HEARST MUSEUM OF ANTHROPOLOGY Leaching Acorns contain a poison called tannic acid. Once all the acorns were pounded into meal, the poison was removed in order to make them safe to eat. First, women scooped out a large basin in the ground. Next, they spread the acorn meal out in the basin and placed branches over it. Then, they poured water through the branches into the basin. Once the acorn meal no longer tasted bitter, the soaking could stop. After the acorn meal drained, it was scooped out of the hole by hand. This is called leaching. Now the meal was ready to be cooked. Essie Parish (Kashaya Pomo) leaching acorn meal, shore of Gualala River, Mendocino Co.; 1961 PHOEBE A. HEARST MUSEUM OF ANTHROPOLOGY Boiling Water and acorn meal were mixed together and boiled into a thin soup or thicker mush. There were two ways that California Indian women boiled food.',\n",
       " 'One way was to boil the mush in a clay or stone pot over a fire. The other way to boil food was by stone boiling. Boiling baskets were often coated with a thin layer of acorn gruel. The gruel was like a glue that coated the basket so that no water would leak from it. Hot rocks the size of tennis balls were heated by fire. Then, they were put into baskets filled with water and acorn meal. Essie Parish (Kashaya Pomo) boiling acorn meal, shore of Gualala River, Mendocino Co.; 1960 PHOEBE A. HEARST MUSEUM OF ANTHROPOLOGY The stones were stirred in the baskets gently and slowly with a wooden paddle or looped stirrer. When the mixture began to boil it was cooked. The stones were then removed from the basket with wooden tongs. The mush that dried onto the rocks was a special treat that children liked to peel off and eat. These pieces were called \"acorn chips.\" Essie Parrish (Kashaya Pomo) cooking acorn bread on hot rocks, Kashaya Rancheria, Sonoma Co.; 1960 PHOEBE A. HEARST MUSEUM OF ANTHROPOLOGY Animals California Indians ate many different kinds of animals. Meat and fish provided them with the protein their bodies needed. Small animals were plentiful, and many groups ate rabbits, rats, squirrels, mice, and chipmunks. Water and land birds such as quail and grouse were also important food for California Indians, especially for those groups that lived in the marshy Central Valley. Large animals such as deer, elk, antelope, mountain sheep, and bear were also eaten, though they were more difficult to hunt and kill. PHOEBE A. HEARST MUSEUM OF ANTHROPOLOGY Hunters used many different tools to capture and kill the animals they ate.',\n",
       " 'They used bows and arrows, throwing sticks, clubs, spears, knives, slings, snares, nets, traps, pits, and dogs. Individuals or small groups of men usually did the hunting, although women and children helped catch rabbits, squirrels, mice, and other small game. When families left the village on food-gathering trips, the men hunted and the women collected plants.

HEARST MUSEUM OF ANTHROPOLOGY Fish such as salmon, trout, and eel were often the main animal foods for many California Indians. Like acorns, fish can be dried and stored easily. Fish was eaten by tribes that lived close to rivers and streams. Groups living near the ocean ate clams, mussels, and crabs. Clamshells were often used to make beads. Groups living near the ocean also hunted sea mammals such as seals, sea lions, and sea otters. Although California Indians did not hunt whales, if one died and was washed ashore, it was eaten. Food from the Sea, Rivers and Lakes Karuk man fishing with an A-frame lifting net, Klamath River, Humboldt Co.; 1901-1907 Fishing Fish were caught with nets, hooks, harpoons, traps, and poison plants. Soaproot, buckeye nuts, and wild cucumber root can be used to capture fish. The plant or nut is mashed up and thrown into the water. The toxins in the plant para- lyze the fish and they float to the surface of the water. The fish are easily gathered up in this paralyzed state. The fish only stay paralyzed for a short time. If they are not gathered quickly enough, they come back to their senses and swim away.',\n",
       " 'The toxins are not dangerous to humans and they do not change the taste of the fish or make it harmful to eat. PHOEBE A. HEARST MUSEUM OF ANTHROPOLOGY Salmon Recipe Ask an adult if they will help you make this recipe sometime when you are camping or at the beach. Ingredients: Salmon Preparation: 1. Build a fire. 2. Clean the fish and cut it in half or cut into meal size chunks. 3. Skewer the fish on a stick (preferably a sturdy willow). 4. Place the fish on a stick into the ground very close to the hot coals (like the picture shows.) 5. Turn the fish over, as the bottom will cook quickly. This is a great campfire meal. Serve with salad, a baked potato or corn on the cob. Salmon cooking over an alder wood fire, Yurok Brush Dance, mouth of the Klamath River, 1993 PHOEBE A. HEARST MUSEUM OF ANTHROPOLOGY PHOEBE A.

HEARST MUSEUM OF ANTHROPOLOGY Insects Many kinds of insects were gathered especially in the Great Basin Area. These included grasshoppers, crickets, caterpillars, earthworms, and flies. Insects are high in protein. They were gathered by hand and collected in baskets. The Maidu really liked dried locusts and crickets, and they traded them. The Nisenan preferred grasshoppers. The Eastern Mono ate caterpillars. Insects were often roasted over hot coals. The Maidu liked to eat grasshoppers that were dried or roasted. The Wintu usually boiled and dried grasshoppers. The Cauhilla liked to roast or dry crickets. Josepea Dick (Central Pomo) with a basket of army worms, near Ukiah, Mendocino Co.; 1904 PHOEBE A. HEARST MUSEUM OF ANTHROPOLOGY PHOEBE A.',\n",
       " 'HEARST MUSEUM OF ANTHROPOLOGY Beverages Drinks included water, berry juices, ciders, nut drinks, and herbal teas. Berry ciders and herbal teas were popular, especially as medicines. Berry juices were a favorite. The Pomo made juices from elderberries and manzanita berries. The Chukchansi Yokuts drank fresh wild grape juice. Many groups made drinks from pounded nuts. Tübatulabal mixed small seeds with cold water to make a thick gruel. Mothers often served the gruel to their children as a snack between meals. Mollie Cheepo (North Fork Mono) winnowing manzanita meal in preparation for making manzanita cider, Madera Co.; 1918 PHOEBE A. HEARST MUSEUM OF ANTHROPOLOGY Salt The most important mineral was salt, which was used by almost all California groups as a condiment to flavor food. A lump of salt might also be chewed by itself. In some areas salt was considered a medicine for curing stomachaches and colds. Salt came from seaweed, grass, mineral deposits, and saline water (from marshes, springs, lakes, and the ocean). Sara Smith Ballard (Coast Miwok) gathering salt with brush and shell spoon, Bodega Bay, Sonoma Co.; 1961 PHOEBE A. HEARST MUSEUM OF ANTHROPOLOGY Drying Foods Many foods were dried either by the sun, by fire, or by smoke before they were eaten. Drying food was a way to preserve it so it would not spoil. Food was also dried to be stored for the winter months. If fish like salmon was not eaten fresh, it was cut into strips and smoke-dried. Some groups also smoke-dried deer meat and acorns. The Tolowa dried their seaweed cakes in the sun. The Tübatulabal laid out wild grapes in the sun to make raisins. The Owens Valley Paiute dried berries. The Luiseño dried the peeled fruit of the prickly pear cactus in the sun.',\n",

HEARST MUSEUM OF ANTHROPOLOGY Earth Ovens California Indians made different kinds of earth ovens to cook meat or plants in. A hole was dug in the earth and was lined with hot rocks. A layer of green leaves was then put over the hot rocks. Next, a thin layer of food, then another layer of leaves, then stones were added. These layers were repeated several times until the pit was filled to the top. Finally, a layer of soil was placed on the top and a fire was lit. The food was left to cook overnight. The Wintu used pits for baking salmon. The Pomo baked Indian potatoes and buckeyes in earth ovens. The Sierra Miwok baked greens and acorn bread in pits. Family of Essie Parrish (Kashaya Pomo) opening up a pit oven with acorn bread, Gualala River, Mendocino Co.; 1961 PHOEBE A. HEARST MUSEUM OF ANTHROPOLOGY Serving Utensils The most important utensil was a spoon. Knives were only used to prepare food. Forks were not used. The most common kind of spoon in the region was a large mussel shell. The Tübatulabal used antelope horn and wood to carve spoons with. The Mohave made spoons and ladles from clay. In the Klamath River Region spoons were made from elk antler. Hupa wooden spoon,Yurok elk antler spoon,Yurok deer bone spoon, Pomo mussel shell spoon, Mohave painted ceramic spoon PHOEBE A. HEARST MUSEUM OF ANTHROPOLOGY Food Storage Food was often stored in baskets and pots. The Yurok and the Pomo stored dried fish in large baskets. Southern groups such as the Cahuilla stored seeds and other foods in large clay pots.',\n",
       " 'Southern tribes also stored large amounts of food in granaries made of twigs. Miwok granaries could hold up to 500 pounds of dry acorns! In the northern and eastern regions, pits were often used to store food. Pits were dug in the ground and lined with bark or grass. The Karuk stored dried fish in a pit at the back of the house. Miwok acorn cache, Calaveras Co.; 1906 PHOEBE A. HEARST MUSEUM OF ANTHROPOLOGY Feasts Native Californians looked forward to feasts where they had the chance to eat special foods. Neighboring groups met and socialized at feasts. Feasts were a time for trading, games, and dances. Many occasions called for feasts. Weddings were celebrated with feasts, as well as seasonal events such as the arrival of the first salmon or the acorn harvest. Feasts were often a time for trading foods after a harvest. Owens Valley Paiute traded salt, pine nuts, and other seeds for acorns and manzanita berries brought by the Western Mono, who lived nearby. Mary Eslick and Bertha Peters (Yurok sisters) cooking acorn soup, Ferndale, Humboldt Co.; 1996 PHOEBE A. HEARST MUSEUM OF ANTHROPOLOGY California Indians learned to gather food when they were about the same age as a fourth grader. As children played they also learned how to look for food. When Atsugewi children were about 8 years old they went food gathering with their parents. Boys went with their fathers and girls with their mothers. Girls played \"house\". Using sticks they pretended to dig roots and pound dirt like acorns. At the age of ten boys would hunt with their fathers and girls helped gather and prepare acorns with their mothers.

       " \"HEARST MUSEUM OF ANTHROPOLOGY Woodrat and his sister were both married. His sister's husband was Red- headed-woodpecker. The two families lived in separate houses and had separate stores of food. All year round, Red-headed-woodpecker had plenty of acorns. Woodrat also had saved up a large store of acorns. Unfortunately, during the winter his store became exhausted. He heard his sister pounding acorns to make mush so he went over to visit her. After she had pounded the acorns into meal, she took it home and leached it in the usual manner. Then she placed the meal in the basket and began to cook mush with hot rocks. Woodrat thought he had better wash his hands so he could eat some of the mush when it was cooked. He did this and sat down on the opposite side of the fire and waited. However, Red-headed-woodpecker, who was a very stingy fellow came home. Woodrat's sister had, at times before this been generous and given Woodrat something to eat, but Red-headed-woodpecker would give him nothing. Woodrat is Refused Food by his Brother-in-law PHOEBE A. HEARST MUSEUM OF ANTHROPOLOGY Woodrat sat there and watched them eat but ate no food himself. Then he began to weep and he wept so long that his eyes became red and his eye-lids swelled until they nearly closed his eyes. He has had very small eyes ever since. When his sister began to cook mush he thought he was going to eat some, so he went out and washed his hands very thoroughly. This is the reason why he has always had white hands ever since. PHOEBE A. HEARST MUSEUM OF ANTHROPOLOGY Once Coyote was traveling along and he was very hun- gry.\",\n",
       " \"He saw a woman and he thought to himself, “How can I trick this woman into feeding me?” The woman did not know that Coyote was a great trickster. And so he walked up to the woman and said, “I can make a fine stew out of stones.” The woman asked, “How are you going to do that?” Coyote said, “Well, watch me!” He asked for the frying pan, and he put some rocks in it. Then he asked the woman for a little lard, and then he asked her for a little meat, and then a little garlic, and then a little tomato and onion, and some salt. He put each of the ingredients together in a frying pan. The woman was astonished at Coyote's way of cooking. He said, “That's my way of cooking stew!” He then ate all of the stew, leaving only the rocks. Coyote’s Stone Stew Writing Activity Now that you have read two California Indian myths, write your own!

Berry ciders and herbal teas were popular, especially as medicines. Berry juices were a favorite. The Pomo made juices from elderberries and manzanita berries. The Chukchansi Yokuts drank fresh wild grape juice. Many groups made drinks from pounded nuts. Tübatulabal mixed small seeds with cold water to make a thick gruel. Mothers often served the gruel to their children as a snack between meals. Mollie Cheepo (North Fork Mono) winnowing manzanita meal in preparation for making manzanita cider, Madera Co.; 1918 PHOEBE A. HEARST MUSEUM OF ANTHROPOLOGY Salt The most important mineral was salt, which was used by almost all California groups as a condiment to flavor food. A lump of salt might also be chewed by itself. In some areas salt was considered a medicine for curing stomachaches and colds. Salt came from seaweed, grass, mineral deposits, and saline water (from marshes, springs, lakes, and the ocean). Sara Smith Ballard (Coast Miwok) gathering salt with brush and shell spoon, Bodega Bay, Sonoma Co.; 1961 PHOEBE A. HEARST MUSEUM OF ANTHROPOLOGY Drying Foods Many foods were dried either by the sun, by fire, or by smoke before they were eaten. Drying food was a way to preserve it so it would not spoil. Food was also dried to be stored for the winter months. If fish like salmon was not eaten fresh, it was cut into strips and smoke-dried. Some groups also smoke-dried deer meat and acorns. The Tolowa dried their seaweed cakes in the sun. The Tübatulabal laid out wild grapes in the sun to make raisins. The Owens Valley Paiute dried berries. The Luiseño dried the peeled fruit of the prickly pear cactus in the sun.'},\n",

Essie Parrish (Kashaya Pomo) pounding acorn with a milling stone, Sonoma Co.; 1960 PHOEBE A. HEARST MUSEUM OF ANTHROPOLOGY Acorn Sifting After the acorn meal was pounded, it was then carefully sifted into a fine flour. A few handfuls of meal were put in the sifting basket and the basket was shaken carefully. The fine meal stuck to the basket and the heavier pieces rose to the surface. The larger pieces were put into another basket and the fine flour was swept into a third basket with a soaproot brush. The larger pieces were then pounded again with the next batch of acorns. Essie Parrish (Kashaya Pomo) sifting acorn, Sonoma Co.; 1960 PHOEBE A. HEARST MUSEUM OF ANTHROPOLOGY Leaching Acorns contain a poison called tannic acid. Once all the acorns were pounded into meal, the poison was removed in order to make them safe to eat. First, women scooped out a large basin in the ground. Next, they spread the acorn meal out in the basin and placed branches over it. Then, they poured water through the branches into the basin. Once the acorn meal no longer tasted bitter, the soaking could stop. After the acorn meal drained, it was scooped out of the hole by hand. This is called leaching. Now the meal was ready to be cooked. Essie Parish (Kashaya Pomo) leaching acorn meal, shore of Gualala River, Mendocino Co.; 1961 PHOEBE A. HEARST MUSEUM OF ANTHROPOLOGY Boiling Water and acorn meal were mixed together and boiled into a thin soup or thicker mush. There were two ways that California Indian women boiled food.'},\n",

Miwok acorn cache, Calaveras Co.; 1906 PHOEBE A. HEARST MUSEUM OF ANTHROPOLOGY Feasts Native Californians looked forward to feasts where they had the chance to eat special foods. Neighboring groups met and socialized at feasts. Feasts were a time for trading, games, and dances. Many occasions called for feasts. Weddings were celebrated with feasts, as well as seasonal events such as the arrival of the first salmon or the acorn harvest. Feasts were often a time for trading foods after a harvest. Owens Valley Paiute traded salt, pine nuts, and other seeds for acorns and manzanita berries brought by the Western Mono, who lived nearby. Mary Eslick and Bertha Peters (Yurok sisters) cooking acorn soup, Ferndale, Humboldt Co.; 1996 PHOEBE A. HEARST MUSEUM OF ANTHROPOLOGY California Indians learned to gather food when they were about the same age as a fourth grader. As children played they also learned how to look for food. When Atsugewi children were about 8 years old they went food gathering with their parents. Boys went with their fathers and girls with their mothers. Girls played \"house\". Using sticks they pretended to dig roots and pound dirt like acorns. At the age of ten boys would hunt with their fathers and girls helped gather and prepare acorns with their mothers.

Do you know how your food is cooked? What type of foods do you think California Indians ate? PHOEBE A. HEARST MUSEUM OF ANTHROPOLOGY California Indians were the first people to live in the area now known as California. California had a population of about 310,000 people when Spanish settlers reached the state in 1769. California tribes differed in the languages they spoke, the regions they lived in, and the foods that they ate. California Indians lived all over the state. They lived in different ecological zones. Some tribes lived near the sea, while others lived near rivers or lakes. There were also tribes that lived in the mountains, valleys, and the desert. Certain natural resources were found throughout the state. Groups from different ecological zones often traded. The Nisenan in the mountains traded black oak acorns and sugar-pine nuts for salt, game, fish, roots, grasses, beads, and shells with tribes living near the sea. Tribes living away from the ocean, such as the Cahuilla, traveled to the coast to fish and gather seafood and seaweed. California Indians PHOEBE A. HEARST MUSEUM OF ANTHROPOLOGY Plants California Indians ate many different plant foods; such as acorns, mushrooms, seaweed, and flowering plants. Seeds, berries, nuts, leaves, stems and roots were all parts of plants that were eaten. Plants were gathered from both the land and the sea.'},\n",

Insects are high in protein. They were gathered by hand and collected in baskets. The Maidu really liked dried locusts and crickets, and they traded them. The Nisenan preferred grasshoppers. The Eastern Mono ate caterpillars. Insects were often roasted over hot coals. The Maidu liked to eat grasshoppers that were dried or roasted. The Wintu usually boiled and dried grasshoppers.

       " {'text': 'One way was to boil the mush in a clay or stone pot over a fire. The other way to boil food was by stone boiling. Boiling baskets were often coated with a thin layer of acorn gruel. The gruel was like a glue that coated the basket so that no water would leak from it. Hot rocks the size of tennis balls were heated by fire. Then, they were put into baskets filled with water and acorn meal. Essie Parish (Kashaya Pomo) boiling acorn meal, shore of Gualala River, Mendocino Co.; 1960 PHOEBE A. HEARST MUSEUM OF ANTHROPOLOGY The stones were stirred in the baskets gently and slowly with a wooden paddle or looped stirrer. When the mixture began to boil it was cooked. The stones were then removed from the basket with wooden tongs. The mush that dried onto the rocks was a special treat that children liked to peel off and eat. These pieces were called \"acorn chips.\" Essie Parrish (Kashaya Pomo) cooking acorn bread on hot rocks, Kashaya Rancheria, Sonoma Co.; 1960 PHOEBE A. HEARST MUSEUM OF ANTHROPOLOGY Animals California Indians ate many different kinds of animals. Meat and fish provided them with the protein their bodies needed. Small animals were plentiful, and many groups ate rabbits, rats, squirrels, mice, and chipmunks. Water and land birds such as quail and grouse were also important food for California Indians, especially for those groups that lived in the marshy Central Valley. Large animals such as deer, elk, antelope, mountain sheep, and bear were also eaten, though they were more difficult to hunt and kill. PHOEBE A.

A layer of green leaves was then put over the hot rocks. Next, a thin layer of food, then another layer of leaves, then stones were added. These layers were repeated several times until the pit was filled to the top. Finally, a layer of soil was placed on the top and a fire was lit. The food was left to cook overnight. The Wintu used pits for baking salmon. The Pomo baked Indian potatoes and buckeyes in earth ovens. The Sierra Miwok baked greens and acorn bread in pits.
